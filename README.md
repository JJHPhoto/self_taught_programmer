## First Thoughts

This is my repo of my code that I'm writing while following along with Cory Althoff's book. I have been meaning to start practicing code again after getting let go from a tech role. I wanted to keep an online record of my progress as a way to be accountable. I had started this book last year but got distracted by the job search process and then the job. I'm currently travelling, so I'm hoping I can commit myself to daily practicing code. My plan is to use this Readme as kind of journal as I work through this book.

## First notes

1. The order of operations, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\
   Parentheses outrank exponents, which outrank multiplication and division, which outrank addition and subtraction. if there is a tie among operators, like in the case of `15/3 x 2`, you evaluate from left to right.
2. I'm doing the math equations in these chapters in the Shell. Not sure I can upload that to this repo. Might be fun to figure out if I can.

## Second Thoughts

Of course the first day I start getting back into coding I almost want to take a day off. Not because I don't want to code but because I just got back from taking photos for 4 plus hours and have 700 pluse photos to pick through but I figured I'd at least finish the chapter I was working on yesterday. Who knows if there will be any more than this update to the ReadMe.

## Second notes

1. From the looks of it, I'll be using the shell to practice Comparison Operators. Just getting flashbacks to learning Salesforce & Java on the fly and hoping I passed the evaluation. I did, the second time.
2. The explanation of the difference between `==` and `=` would have been very helpful. Its knowledge I had but the vacabulary used makes more sense reding it here than when I was learning JS.
3. Gonna just ignore the fact that my numbered notes aren't indenting properly.

## Third Thoughts

Functions today. Hoping that I can finish this chapter but rough sleep last night has me hoping to just get to the first challenge. We shall see.

## Third notes

1. I completely forgot that Python lets you return a result of 'None'. I feel like JS doesn't let you do that and will throw an error.
2. 'float', 'str' & 'int' remind me of trying to learn Apex formulas for Salesforce.
3. Fading before the challenge. Just worn ragged by knee pain keeping me up most of the night.

## Fourth Thoughts

Still on the Functions chapter. Trying to get something in today after another sleepless night & long day.

## Day 5

Switching langague to be more in line with my folders but leaving old 'thoughs' idea for ref. Still working through the Functions chapter.

## Day 6

Going to try to finish the challenges today. Realizing from the answers that I'm still not grasping some concepts. Trying to not be frustrated as I'm cramming these in last minute but it is disappointing where I'm at.

Totally mashed up the idea of Challenge 6. Oh well. Live and learn. Pitter patter!

## Day 7

Containers time! Lists, tuples and dictionaries. Those are words. Well, at least two of them are.

Ok, made it through the 'Lists' section and I don't think I have the brain for 'Tuples'. The word just makes my head hurt.

## Day 8 (technically 10)

Just gonna soldier on, even though I 'missed' two days of coding due to various health things sapping any energy I have. What do we have today? Tuples... yeah, that's a word.

The comma needed even if there's only one item in the Tuple is interesting.

Tuples being used as keys in dictionaries is interesting. Also for things that don't change like geo coordinates.

## Day 9

Containers in containers time! Now I'm thinking of the line "I'll put that in a box inside of an other box inside another box, mail it to myself and smash it with a hammer!"

## Day 10

The plan is to finish the Containers challenges. We shall see if lack of sleep prevents that.

Only did three for the locations cause apparently the site I was using had a data quota.... And I did it wrong. I thought I was supposed to make a [] but decided to just make tuples.

It looks like the main argument for using Sets is the speed of being able to check the membership of a value in a Set.

## Day 11

Give or take a few. Starting chapter 6 'String Manipulation' before finishing packing for the next flight. Hoping to find a good place to stop.

So, does triple strings work as more than a way to make notations?

Concatenation... always stumpled on saying that word and I think it caused me to have issues using this method cause I couldn't explain it.

## Day 12

Finding days where I can but cramming in a lot of photography while here near Angkor Wat.

Bacslash to escape Python's special meanings for characters, for instance \'\'. Interesting that you dn't need to escape single quotes inside double quotes and vice versa.

I always got confused withe slicing index thing. To me, I'd often think where you sliced the index was included, but I'd often learn that the slice was the end and not included.

## Day 13

Let's see how many challenges I can get done!

I should have looked up other capitalization methods when I saw mine turned the upper case H into a lower case in Challenge 3. Hmmmm... that's not right either. I guess I'll just use the `.capitalize()` method and not the `.title()` one since that's closer to the challenge description.

Ok. My issue with the answer to Challenge 4 is that it doesn't include the '?' which is requested in the challenged. I knew I could split it at the '?' but I was looking for a method that included the '?'. I'm going to figure I am still reading these challenges wrong and move forward because I 'had the answer' but didn't understand the question properly.

## Day 14

With Challenge 5, I didn't think to remove the '.' using a '-2' indexing and then add it back at the end of the string.

Challenge 6 was pretty simple, I need to get into the habit of using the same variable as I update it as opposed to creating new variables each time like in JS.

## Day 15

Hoping to finish the challenges but jet lag is rough at the moment.

With Challenge 7, I had the right logic but I just added unnecessary code using the `try/catch` method.

Challenge 8 was more simple than I expected. I keep doing this. I keep expecting things to be more difficult than necessary.

I really need to do these challenges quicker. I keep pushing them off till it has been a few days/weeks since I read the chapter. I completely forgot about the concat & mult methods that were used in Challenge 9.

Challenge 10 was a something I understood but didn't know. I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't know I had to `slice` at the index. I thought I could at the `','`.

## Day 16

Jet lag has been rough but looking forward to getting back into this book. Though, Loops were never my strong suite.

I am enjoying the `for-loops` in Python. Much less complicated that JS. Or maybe this guy explains it better than Anthony.

## Day 17

I am enjoying getting some coding in during the mornings before the day gets going. Today I'll be working in `Range` of `for-loops`.

Oh, I guess `Range` is just a small part of this chapter. On to `While-Loops`. Those were interesting when I was working in `Java/Apex`.

Ok, I'll end at the `Break`. Get it?
