## First Thoughts

This is my repo of my code that I'm writing while following along with Cory Althoff's book. I have been meaning to start practicing code again after getting let go from a tech role. I wanted to keep an online record of my progress as a way to be accountable. I had started this book last year but got distracted by the job search process and then the job. I'm currently travelling, so I'm hoping I can commit myself to daily practicing code. My plan is to use this Readme as kind of journal as I work through this book.

## First notes

1. The order of operations, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\
   Parentheses outrank exponents, which outrank multiplication and division, which outrank addition and subtraction. if there is a tie among operators, like in the case of `15/3 x 2`, you evaluate from left to right.
2. I'm doing the math equations in these chapters in the Shell. Not sure I can upload that to this repo. Might be fun to figure out if I can.

## Second Thoughts

Of course the first day I start getting back into coding I almost want to take a day off. Not because I don't want to code but because I just got back from taking photos for 4 plus hours and have 700 pluse photos to pick through but I figured I'd at least finish the chapter I was working on yesterday. Who knows if there will be any more than this update to the ReadMe.

## Second notes

1. From the looks of it, I'll be using the shell to practice Comparison Operators. Just getting flashbacks to learning Salesforce & Java on the fly and hoping I passed the evaluation. I did, the second time.
2. The explanation of the difference between `==` and `=` would have been very helpful. Its knowledge I had but the vacabulary used makes more sense reding it here than when I was learning JS.
3. Gonna just ignore the fact that my numbered notes aren't indenting properly.

## Third Thoughts

Functions today. Hoping that I can finish this chapter but rough sleep last night has me hoping to just get to the first challenge. We shall see.
