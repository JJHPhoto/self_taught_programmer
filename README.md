## First Thoughts

This is my repo of my code that I'm writing while following along with Cory Althoff's book. I have been meaning to start practicing code again after getting let go from a tech role. I wanted to keep an online record of my progress as a way to be accountable. I had started this book last year but got distracted by the job search process and then the job. I'm currently travelling, so I'm hoping I can commit myself to daily practicing code. My plan is to use this Readme as kind of journal as I work through this book.
